# My First Project

This project is based on my Module called "CSD3600 Open Source Software".

I will be working on Java Programming and HTML, CSS and Java Scripting in this project. 

The aim of this project is to improve my skills and keep doing practice on Java Programming and Website Designing. 

In my opinion Open Source Software is very useful tool and we can share our resources with others; learn from others mew skills.

I just satrted working on my new project about Java Programming which is about a Banking System.

My aim is to improve my skills about Java Programming. 

At the beginning I find it hard how to get started my Open Source Project which is really useful to learn new IT Skills. 

Recently I have created few basic Java Programs called Age, Grades and Mobiles.
